## <a id="intro"></a> Varying Data

So far in this course you have seen
how to ask for the `min`, `max`, and
`sum` of a list of numbers.  In the context
of the menu, this is great for finding
things like the menu item with the lowest
amount of carbohydrates, or the highest
sodium.

But now, imagine we had two different 
data sets:  one list containing the heights
of many different dogs, and another containing
the heights of many different humans.  We want
to know the answer to this question:  are dogs
taller than humans?

*Actually ask the students this question.  Most
should say that humans are taller.  Provide 
counter examples (great dane is taller than most
elementary school students;  Zeus the great 
dane was 3 ft 8, taller than most kids in elementary
school!).  If any say dogs are taller, bring 
up Sultan KÃ¶sen, world tallest man.*
