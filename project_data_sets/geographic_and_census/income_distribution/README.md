# Income Distribution

This data set contains information
about income distribution in the United
States between 1967 and 2015.  The data
is provided by the US Census, found
[here](http://census.gov/data/tables/2016/demo/income-poverty/p60-256.html).

## Potential Questions
 - Graph the mean and median incomes over time.  How are they
   changing?
 - Create 3 new columns:  income under 35k, between 35k and 
   100k, and above 100k.  Graph each column over time. Which
   groups are changing, and how?
