# Data 1

Data 1 is an introductory course in data science.  Students
will be introduced to tabular data, and learn how to 
ask/answer questions about data through computation .  
They will also learn techniques for modeling and visualizing data.
This course aims to provide students with hands on manipulation
of data, and to provide a foundation for statistical modeling/thinking.

### Statistics
 - Categorical/Quantitative/Bivariate Data
 - Mean/Median/Mode
 - Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Dot Plots
 - Histograms
 - Scatter Plots
 - Standard Deviation
 - Linear Regression

### Programming
 - Relational (Tabular) Data
 - Selecting/Filtering/Ordering/Extending Tables
 - Min, Max, Sum
 - Lists
 - Data Visualization

## Unit 1 - Tools for Data

Students are introduced to Google Sheets as a 
convenient method of gathering and storing data.  They will 
create their first Google Sheets document, then load
 these responses into a Table in Pyret.

## Unit 2 - Introduction to Table Manipulation

Students are introduced to table manipulation functions  selecting and
ordering.  After practicing ordering by hand,
the students will use the table manipulation 
functions to answer questions, and receive a refresher on how
to write fundamental Pyret expressions.

## Unit 3 - More Table Manipulation

Students expand their toolset of table manipulation functions 
with the sieve and extend keywords.  After motivating these
concepts as ways to ask questions from Tables, the students
will write Pyret code to answer such questions.

## Unit 4 - Introduction to Lists

Students are introduced to lists as another kind of 
collection of data.  After manually calculating
sum, min, max from lists of numbers, students learn
to use the Pyret math library to compute these
values.

## Unit 5 - Statistics and Lists

Students are introduced to different representations of a 'center' of
a data sample (Mean, Median).  After practicing mean, median
by hand, they are introduced to the Pyret statistics library 
and compute these values with expressions.

## Unit 6 - Visualizing Categorical Data

Students learn several techniques for visualizing
categorical data:  bar charts, pie charts, and
dot plots.  Students will create visualizations
for different data sense, and develop a sense 
for how to use different visualization techniques.

## Unit 7 - Visualizing Quantitative Data

Students learn to visualized quantitative 
data using histograms.  Then students
generate histograms for several data sets
to learn how to analyze 'shapes' of data,
including symmetric, skewed, bell-shaped,
uniform, etc.

## Unit 8 - Analysis of Bivariate Data

Students begin to ask questions about the relationship between different
variables in a data set.  Students are introduced to 
scatter plots as ways to visualize bivariate data,
and linear regression as a method of analyzing 
a relationship 

## Unit 9 - Data Sanitizing
Students are introduced to the concept of data sanitizing by
attempting to ask questions about unsanitary data from a survey they
fill out.  Then get practice sanitizing a real data set.

## Unit 10 - Final Project
Students choose a dataset from a list of provided data sets, and
ask questions about the data.  They will then fill in a template
slideshow for their dataset and present their work to the class.

## Supplemental Activities
 - Conduct a Class Survey (issues with privacy, designing questions)
 - Importing and loading a music library
 - Prepare and use a data set from the internet
