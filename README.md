# Data 1

Data 1 is an introductory course in data science.  
Students will be introduced to tabular data, 
and learn how to ask/answer questions about data 
through computation.  They will also learn techniques 
for modeling and visualizing data. This course aims 
to provide students with hands on manipulation
of data, and to provide a foundation for 
statistical modeling/thinking.

### Statistics
 - Categorical/Quantitative/Bivariate Data
 - Mean/Median/Mode (Center)
 - Standard Deviation (Spread)
 - Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Dot Plots
 - Histograms
 - Scatter Plots
 - Linear Regression

### Programming
 - Relational (Tabular) Data
 - Selecting/Filtering/Ordering/Extending Tables
 - Min, Max, Sum
 - Lists
 - Data Visualization

## Unit 1 - Tools for Data

Students are introduced to Google Sheets as a 
convenient method of gathering and storing data.  
They will create their first Google Sheets document, 
then load these responses into a Table in Pyret.

## Unit 2 - Introduction to Tabular Data

Students develop a vocabulary for
classifying data (categorical, quantitative).

## Unit 3 - Table Manipulation Part 1

Students are introduced to table manipulation 
functions selecting and ordering.  After practicing 
ordering by hand, the students will use the table 
manipulation functions to answer questions, and 
receive a refresher on how to write fundamental 
Pyret expressions.

## Unit 4 - Table Manipulation Part 2

Students expand their toolset of table manipulation 
functions with the sieve and extend keywords.  
After motivating these concepts as ways to ask 
questions from Tables, the students
will write Pyret code to answer such questions.

## Unit 5 - Introduction to Lists

Students are introduced to lists as another kind of 
collection of data.  After manually calculating
sum, min, max from lists of numbers, students learn
to use the Pyret math library to compute these
values.

## Unit 6 - Statistics and Lists

Students are introduced to different representations 
of a 'center' of a data sample (Mean, Median).  
After practicing mean, median by hand, they are 
introduced to the Pyret statistics library 
and compute these values with expressions.

## Unit 7 - Visualizing Categorical Data

Students learn several techniques for visualizing
categorical data:  bar charts, pie charts, and
dot plots.  Students will create visualizations
for different data sense, and develop a sense 
for how to use different visualization techniques.

## Unit 8 - Visualizing Quantitative Data

Students learn to visualized quantitative 
data using histograms.  Then students
generate histograms for several data sets
to learn how to analyze 'shapes' of data,
including symmetric, skewed, bell-shaped,
uniform.

## Unit 9 - Analysis of Two Categorical Variables

Students examine the relationship between 
categorical variables using two-way
frequency tables, and interpret relative,
joint, and marginal frequencies.

## Unit 10 - Analysis of Bivariate Data

Students begin to ask questions about the relationship 
between different variables in a data set.  Students 
are introduced to scatter plots as ways to visualize 
bivariate data, and linear regression as a method 
of analyzing a relationship.

## Unit 11 - Final Project
Students choose a dataset from a list of provided 
data sets, and ask questions about the data.  They 
will then fill in a template slideshow for their 
dataset and present their work to the class.

## Supplement 1 - Conducting a Survey
Conduct a survey using Google forms: formulate a
question to be answered, determine how best to
randomly sample a population, design the question(s)
to minimize bias & maintain user privacy.

## Supplement 2 - Import and Load a Music Library
Students choose from several resources 
(iTunes, Spotify, last.fm) and answer questions 
using table manipulation techniques.

## Supplement 3 - Use an Internet Dataset
Students learn how to find open tabular data,
import that data into Google Sheets, and 
use Pyret's sanitizing functionality to allow 
for analysis of this data.
