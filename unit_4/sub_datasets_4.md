# Unit 2:  Categorical and Quantitative Data

This document assumes you have followed the 
instructions from Unit 1 to import your
desired data set into Google Sheets/have a link
to a public Google Sheet containing your desired
data.

## Categorical and Quantitative Data

The following are target aspects that we
recommend you have in your data that is
being substituted:

 - The table should contain at least 4
   columns, with at least 2 examples of 
   categorical and quantitative data each.
 - The columns with categorical data should
   have a relatively small number of possible
   categories (ideally less than 10, hopefully
   less than 50 unless the category is relatively
   well known like different U.S. States).
 - The quantitative data in this table 
   ideally measures physical quantities that 
   are easy for the students to visualize.
