Below is a table with the id `extracurriculars`.
It holds information about how much time a student
spends outside of class playing sports & watching
TV for a particular day of the week.  

| day         | sports | tv | total |
|-------------|--------|----|-------|
| "Monday"    | 45     | 30 | 75    |
| "Tuesday"   | 75     | 30 |       |
| "Wednesday" | 45     | 30 |       |
| "Thursday"  | 30     | 90 |       |
| "Friday"    | 45     | 0  |       |
| "Saturday"  | 60     | 30 |       |
| "Sunday"    | 0      | 45 |       |

There's a special column called `total`,
which we want to contain the total amount of time
the student spends watching tv and playing sports
on a particular day.  The first value is filled in.

 - Fill out the rest of the values in the `total` column.
 - What two values are you using to compute the 
   `total` for each row?  How do you use the two values?
