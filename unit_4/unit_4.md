# Unit 4

### Agenda:

### Product Outcomes:

Students are introduced to lists as
ordered collections of data.  They 
learn to extract lists from tables
and calculate relevant values from 
lists (sum, min, max).

### Standards and Evidence Statements: 

### Length: 45 Minutes

### Glossary:
 - **Lists**:  An ordered collection of data, which
   can be of any type.
 -
 
### Materials:

### Preparation:
 - Each student (or pair) has a Google account

## <a id="lists"></a> Introduction to Lists

So far you've used Tables as a way to store
data.  Today, you'll learn a different way
to store data in Pyret:  lists.

Lists are ordered collections of data.  Here is
an example of a list in Pyret:

```
[list: 1, "Arr", true]
```

This list contains 3 values:  a Number with value 1,
a String with value "Arr", and a Boolean with value true.

### Group Exercise

```
l1 = [list: 1, "hi", 3]
l2 = [list: "Captain", "Pirate"]
l3 = [list: 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.9]
```

 - How many elements are in `l1`?
 - How many elements are in `l2`?
 - How many elements are in `l3`?
 - What is the sum of all elements in `l3`?

### Functions that consume lists
