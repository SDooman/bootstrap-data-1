## <a id="intro"></a> Introduction
Welcome to Bootstrap Data 1!  In this course, you will learn about
Tables:  a widely used way of arranging data.  Almost every website
you have ever seen uses tables in the form of databases. By learning
how to use tables, you'll be able to ask and answer questions using
almost any kind of data you can find!

## <a id="tables"></a> What are Tables?
Let's start with an example:

| First Name | Last Name | Age | Grade | Favorite Class | Favorite Food |
|------------|-----------|-----|-------|----------------|---------------|
| John       | Doe       | 8   | 4     | Math           | Pizza         |
| Jane       | Smith     | 9   | 4     | Art            | Tacos         |
| Javon      | Jackson   | 8   | 4     | Recess         | Pizza         |
| Angela     | Enriquez  | 8   | 4     | Science        | Cake          |
| Anthony    | Thompson  | 9   | 4     | Recess         | Pasta         |
| Dominique  | Rodriguez | 8   | 4     | History        | Hamburgers    |

This is a table with information about students in a 4th grade class.
The information in a table is arranged into **rows** and **columns**.
In the example, each column has all the values for a certain **attribute**
of a person.  For example, the 3rd column contains the age of
each person in the class.  Here, the **attribute** is Age.

The very top row in this table is a special row:  Every value in the top row
is the name of an **attribute**.  We call this the **header row**.  Every
other row in the table is called a **record**, and contains values for 
every **attribute** or **column**.  In our example, each **record** represents
a person, and each value in the record is a person's Age, Favorite Food, etc.
