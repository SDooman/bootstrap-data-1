# Data 1

Data 1 is an introductory course in data science.  Students
will be introduced to tabular data, and learn how to 
ask/answer questions about data through computation .  
They will also learn techniques for modeling and visualizing data.
This course aims to provide students with hands on manipulation
of data, and to provide a foundation for statistical modeling/thinking.

### Statistics
 - Mean/Median/Mode
 - Histograms
 - Scatter Plots
 - Standard Deviation
 - Linear Regression

### Programming
 - Tabluar/Categorical data
 - Selecting/Filtering/Ordering tables
 - Lists
 - Data Sanitation
 - Data Visualization

## Unit 0 - Pyret Introduction/Refresher

Students who have never programmed in Pyret before
will receive an introduction to fundamental principles
necessary in this course (expressions, function definition
and application, variables, data types).

## Unit 1 - Tools for Data

Students are introduced to Google Sheets as a 
convenient method of gathering and storing data.  They will 
create their first Google Sheets document, then load
 these responses into a Table in Pyret.

### Additional Exercises
 - Generating Data with Surveys
 - Loading your music library table

## Unit 2 - Asking Questions with Tables

Students are introduced to table manipulation functions:  selecting,
ordering, and filtering.  After practicing ordering and filtering by hand,
the students will use the table manipulation functions to answer questions.  
The students also receive a brief
introduction/refresher on how to write simple Pyret expressions.

### Additional Exercises
 - Extending Tables

## Unit 3 - Asking Questions with Lists

Students are introduced to different representations of a 'center' of
a data sample (Mean, Median).  After practicing mean, median, sum, 
by hand, they are introduced to lists and functions for manipulating
lists.

### Additional Exercises
 - Writing your own list functions

## Unit 4 - More Questions with Lists

Building on Unit 3, students are introduced to different representations
of the 'spread' of a data sample (min, max, standard deviation).  After
practicing these by hand, they are introduced to their respective 
list functions.

## Unit 5 - Data Visualization

Students are introduced to different data visualization techniques:
scatter plots, histograms.  Through experimenting visualizing different
data sets, students learn when to use each technique.

## Unit 6 - Regression

Students begin to ask questions about the relationship between different
variables in a data set.  Students are introduced to linear regression,
and how to apply/visualize it.

## Unit 7 - Data Sanitizing
Students are introduced to the concept of data sanitizing by
attempting to ask questions about unsanitary data from a survey they
fill out.  Then get practice sanitizing a real data set.

## Supplemental Activities
 - Conduct a Class Survey (issues with privacy, designing questions)
 - Prepare and use a data set from the internet
