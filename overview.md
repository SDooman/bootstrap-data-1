# Data 1

Data 1 is an introductory course in data science.  Students
will be introduced to tabular data, and learn how to 
ask/answer questions about data through computation .  
They will also learn techniques for modeling and visualizing data.
This course aims to provide students with hands on manipulation
of data, and to provide a foundation for statistical modeling/thinking.

### Statistics
 - Mean/Median/Mode
 - Histograms
 - Scatter Plots
 - Standard Deviation
 - Linear Regression

### Programming
 - Tabular data
 - Selecting/Filtering/Ordering tables
 - Lists
 - Data Sanitation
 - Data Visualization

## Unit 1

Students are introduced to Google sheets as a convenient method
of storing data.  They learn to create sheets and load tables into Pyret.

## Unit 2

Students begin to experiment with table manipulation functions:  selecting,
ordering, and filtering.  The students will use these to answer questions
about a variety of data sets.

## Unit 3

Students explore different representations of the 'center' of a 
data sample (Mean, Median).  They then learn how to extract table columns
into lists, and to calculate these values from the lists.

## Unit 4

Students are introduced to different data visualization techniques:
scatter plots, histograms.  Through experimenting visualizing different
data sets, students learn when to use each technique.

## Unit 5

Students visualize different data sets and begin describing data 'shape'.
Learn to quantify the spread of data distribution with standard deviation.

## Unit 6

Students begin to ask questions about the relationship between different
variables in a data set.  Students are introduced to linear regression,
and how to apply/visualize it.

## Unit 7

Students are exposed to real world data sets and learn to sanitize 
them.

## Unit 8

Students use their knowledge from the previous units to conduct a survey
through Google Forms of their friends and family.
